## üì° Project Overview

This repository features the design and analysis of a **coplanar waveguide (CPW)-fed planar monopole antenna** with broadband circular polarization.

## üìù Abstract

A CPW-fed planar monopole antenna is optimized for **broadband operation and circular polarization** in the WLAN (5 GHz) bands. The design leverages an inverted L-shaped slot in the ground plane and a parallel-aligned inverted-L-shaped strip to achieve a **fractional bandwidth for circular polarization exceeding 33%**. This approach yields:
- Simple yet efficient radiator design
- Wide 3-dB axial-ratio operating band
- Compact size

The antenna is suitable for RFID readers, and wireless communication networks due to its broad circular polarization and robust performance.

## üßë‚Äçüî¨ Brief Theory

- **Planar Antennas:** Both active and parasitic elements are on a single plane, making them compact and suitable for modern wireless applications.
- **CPW Monopole Antenna:** Utilizes coplanar waveguide transmission lines for feeding, offering broader bandwidth, higher gain, and compact size compared to traditional monopole antennas.
- **Design Innovations:** Slot modifications (inverted L-shaped, U-shaped, curved, etc.) are employed to overcome the typical limitations of planar antennas, such as narrow bandwidth and low gain.
